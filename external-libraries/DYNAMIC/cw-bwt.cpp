	 *
	 * It is possible (see comments below) also to build the bwt from/to strings, but in this way also the input/output strings will be stored in memory,
	 * resulting in higher RAM requirements.
	 *
	 * If you want to keep RAM usage to a minimum, it is recommended that you proceed as follows:
	 *
	 * 1) save your text (string/array) to disk
	 * 2) free memory
	 * 3) run cw-bwt loading the text from the file created in step 1) (see below)
	 * 4) save directly the bwt to disk (see below)
	 * 5) free memory
	 * 6) load in RAM the bwt created in step 4)
